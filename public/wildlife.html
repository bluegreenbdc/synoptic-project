<br><br><h2><u>Lobitos and Piedritas, Our Wildlife, Our Inspiration</u></h2>
Ecoswell, one of the largest helpers in our community, was inspired by our tourist-attracting surfing, our amazing people, but most importantly our natural beauty and wildlife. Here in Northern Peru, we pride ourselves on what we have, but with each passing day our wildlife and our ecosystem needs help.<br><br>
     
Our current built environment shapes the experience each tourist will have. Both towns currently feature great hotels with new houses and give a feeling of self worth to those planning to move in. Lobitos hosts around 58 hostels and hotels along with other amenities whilst Piedritas has built itself a healthy tradition of animal farming and logging. With vegetation restoring, now is the prime time to come to Piedritas and work on improving the local agriculture for the animals and the people!<br><br>
     
Each year our fish get poached by illegal commercial fishers and our ecosystem gets torn. Due to poor sanitation, the people defecate everywhere and pollute the very place they sleep; nature is driven away by our poor living situation… <b>here’s how you can potentially help improve it.</b><br><br>

With the help of Ecoswell, our lives have been improving. We’ve slowly been having improved designs to provide clean water, adequate sanitation and disposal of waste which is helping us slowly but we need to also help ourselves.<br><br>

The food we pride ourselves on is hard to obtain and one of the ways we aim to obtain it in Piedritas is Agroforestry. Here’s a short rundown of what Agroforestry is:<br><br>

Agroforestry, done near a small stream in Quebrada pariñas, is the practice of growing trees or shrubs around agriculture to reduce water loss in these arid heats and to help our crops grow. With some small success, it would be good as a community if we could band together and expand on this further, potentially using other nearby streams and rivers to our advantage. This would let us reduce the cost of travel and help our local community better with fresh food straight from the plant itself. Though difficult, it has not proven impossible and if you came down, I’m sure we could teach you all we know!<br><br>

Food production is challenging with our environmental stressors, so it’s our job to make sure we get as much efficient food as possible using environmentally stable business practices and movements. <br>
To find out more, talk to our local legend, Augusto Correa of Hotel Buenavista Lobitos who promotes such practices!
