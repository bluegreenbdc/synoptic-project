<u><h2>Lobitos and Piedritas, a Fishing Paradise </h2></u>
Lobitos and Piedritas is a humble home to a mountain of industries, one such industry being artisanal fishing, where 50% of our inhabitants are employed!<br><br>
<b>What is artisanal fishing you may ask?</b><br>
Artisanal fishing is the art of fishing the old-fashioned way. Rod and tackle, harpoon or fishing net, we like to use things simple to feed the locals. With 50% of work coming from this industry, as it grows and grows with large ships porting in Lobitos, each fishing job posted and taken is another person working towards improving our land and economy!<br>

Primavera is the main hot spot for this industry, it’s where some of the most impoverished of Lobitos live and is ran by the Fisherman’s guild. The families here have been here for generations and some will remain for generations to come! Approximately 800 live here who pride themselves on their fishing mastery! <br>

If you’re new to Lobitos, why not come on down and learn how to fish? Lobitos is always looking for more artisan fishers, and here’s a quick guide to get you started on your journey to mastery!<br><br>

    <b>Basic fishing gear</b><br>
To fish in Lobitos and/or Piedritas, you’ll need to get something more than just your hands wet. Around the local area you may find markets and stalls which sell tools and gear ranging from a fishing rod, spears or simple nets and boats to be used, along with long piers. The shallow warm waters make a great hotspot for an easy catch!<br><br>

    <b>How to use it:</b> <br>
The rod – The fishing rod is a long wooden pole which bends and has some extra tools attached made to catch live fish. You’ll often see a reel you can wind up to pull caught fish in to land, some wire which is attached to the hook itself and, sometimes even a lure. Get to know each piece of the gear and how they work. After all is said and done, you can place some live animals such as worms on the end of your hook as bait and cast out your fishing line.<br>

To cast out your line, you can use 2 methods: overhead casting and pitching.<br>
To cast overhead, lean the line back over the top of your head, ensuring behind you is clear, and in one fluid motion, whip the rod forward overhead to cast the line out far. You may need some weights to get some extra distance, but this should be used for long distance fishing.
More common and often, you’ll be doing pitching. <br>
To pitch a rod, all you have to do is a hold the reel in place and slowly put the rod infront of you, before slightly whipping the rod up and swinging the line a short distance into the water. This won’t go very far but is very good for when you have shallow water fish.

once you get a few tugs on your line, you know it’s time to slowly reel in your fish and have a lovely dinner!
